# Demographic Data Analyzer

This project is part of FreeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python certification. The goal is to analyze demographic data using Pandas to answer several questions about the dataset. The code should be written in `demographic_data_analyzer.py`, and all calculations or updates should be reflected in this file.

## Project Description

The project involves analyzing a dataset to answer various demographic questions using Python's Pandas library. You will update the code in `demographic_data_analyzer.py` to perform the necessary calculations, replacing all variables set to `None` with the appropriate code.

## Objectives

1. **Race Representation**: Determine how many people of each race are represented in the dataset. This should be a Pandas series with race names as the index labels.
   
2. **Average Age of Men**: Calculate the average age of men.

3. **Percentage of People with a Bachelor's Degree**: Find the percentage of individuals who have a Bachelor's degree.

4. **Percentage with Advanced Education Earning >50K**: Calculate the percentage of people with advanced education (Bachelors, Masters, or Doctorate) who earn more than 50K.

5. **Percentage without Advanced Education Earning >50K**: Calculate the percentage of people without advanced education who earn more than 50K.

6. **Minimum Number of Work Hours per Week**: Identify the minimum number of hours a person works per week.

7. **Percentage of Minimum Hours Workers Earning >50K**: Calculate the percentage of people working the minimum number of hours per week who have a salary of more than 50K.

8. **Highest Earning Country**: Determine the country with the highest percentage of people earning more than 50K and calculate that percentage.

9. **Most Popular Occupation in India for High Earners**: Identify the most popular occupation for individuals earning more than 50K in India.

## Development

- Write your code in the `demographic_data_analyzer.py` file. 
- You can use `main.py` to test your code during development.

## Testing

- The unit tests for this project are located in `test_module.py`.
- You can run these tests by executing `main.py`, where the tests from `test_module.py` have been imported for convenience.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Write and update the code in `demographic_data_analyzer.py`.
4. Run `main.py` to test your solutions.
5. Ensure that all calculations are accurate and that all unit tests pass.

## Submission

- Once all tests pass, submit your completed `demographic_data_analyzer.py` file to FreeCodeCamp for evaluation.
